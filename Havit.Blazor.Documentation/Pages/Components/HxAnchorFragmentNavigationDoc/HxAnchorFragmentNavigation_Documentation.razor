	<DocAlert Type="DocAlertType.Warning">
		Starting with <code>net8.0</code>, this component is usually no longer needed as Blazor supports anchor-fragment navigation natively.
		There are still some use-cases where this component can be useful, e.g. when you need to navigate to a fragment which renders after the page is loaded.
	</DocAlert>

	<DocAlert Type="DocAlertType.Info">
		As Blazor uses the <code>&lt;base&gt;</code> element, all the links must include the full page path!
